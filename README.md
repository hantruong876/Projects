# 🌲Han's Projects🏞️
I'm still learning new things every day, so there's always room for improvement! Feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions as I continue to grow and explore new ideas!🌱

**🌊Tools:** Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau🌊

## [Project 1: Chinese Retail Stocks Analysis and Prediction under US Tariffs](https://github.com/hantruong876/Chinese-Retail-Stocks-Analysis-and-Prediction-)📈
*Python (pandas, matplotlib, mplfinance,...)*

🏔️This project focuses on analyzing Chinese retail stock (PDD) to track its performance before, during, and after the tariff announcements. I predict its short-term performance and compare it with other retail stocks to assess which sector is most impacted by tariffs. Through fundamental analysis, I explore the reasons behind these changes.

## [Project 2: Company's Employees Profiles and Project Tracking Dashboard](https://github.com/hantruong876/Company-s-Employees-Profiles-and-Project-Tracking-Dashboard)📊
*SQL, Power BI*

🏔️Using a database with 6 tables containing employee information, project progress, budgets, and department data, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard for project tracking. This dashboard allows users to see department-level performance and employee profiles.

The project followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBc2QJIWg1o&t=3145s).🌄

## [Project 3: Analyzing Crime Incidents in 2024](https://github.com/hantruong876/Analyzing-Crime-Incidents-in-2024)🚔
*Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), Tableau*

🏔️My team and I worked with the "[Crime Incidents in 2024](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-incidents-in-2024)" dataset from Data.gov. Our goal was to analyze crime trends and patterns, using Tableau to visualize insights. We uncovered when and where crimes occur most often, what types are most common, and how crime fluctuates throughout the year.
